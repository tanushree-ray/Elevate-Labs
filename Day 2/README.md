# To-Do List Web App

This is a clean and simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

No page reloads required — updates happen instantly using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure  
- `style.css` – Styling for the layout and tasks  
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for dynamic functionality
